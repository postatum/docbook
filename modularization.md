# Modularization

This tutorial shows you how to define and edit reusable modular metadata documents that can be linked together as a linked graph of metadata using AML.

## Before you begin

Prerequisites:

- JVM: version 7 or higher
- SBT to build the AMF command-line


## Download the example

You can download the example from the AML project [examples repository](https://github.com/aml-org/examples) in Github.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aml-org/examples.git
cd examples/modular
```

## Build and install the AMF command-line tool

This tutorial assumes you have a working version of the AMF comand-line as described in the [quickstart](quickstart.md) tutorial.
