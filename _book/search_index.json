declarative language to define metadata documents that can be parsed into graphs of information. These documents can be published and linked in the web or through any other type of API.\nIt can be used to describe common existing YAML/JSON metadata documents or to define the semantics and structure of completely new metadata formats.\nAML metadata documents have the following advantages:\n\nWell defined formal semantics that can be reused across multiple types of metadata\nExplicit schema that can be used to automate parsing and validation\nSupport for hyperlinks as a mechanism to connect and publish metadata documents\nOut of the box modularity, allowing to split the metadata graph into composable sets of documents\nDirect translation into a graph of data that can be stored, queried and published\nSupport for W3C recommendations for the web and metadata\n\nDefining metadata documents\nTo define a new type of metadata document, a AML Dialect must be defined. Maps the structure of a YAML/JSON document to a graph of information and overlays the semantics for the nodes in the graph.\nWith that information an AML processor tool can parse and validate the instances of the metadata document and generate the output graph of information with the defined semantics.\nThis is an example of minimal AML Dialect defining a personal information metadata document:\nvcard.yaml\n#%Dialect 1.0\n\ndialect: Person Card\nversion: 1.0\n\nexternal:\n  schema: http://schema.org/\n\nnodeMappings:\n\n  PersonNode:\n    classTerm: schema.Person\n    mapping:\n      name:\n        propertyTerm: schema.name\n        range: string\n      born:\n        propertyTerm: schema.birthDate\n        range: date\n\ndocuments:\n  root:\n    encodes: PersonNode\n\nWith this information describing a very simple metadata document an AML processor can validate and parse metadata descriptions according to the defined \"Person Card\" format:\nchuck_berry.yaml\n#%Person Card 1.0\n\nname: Chuck Berry\nborn: 1926-10-18\n\nThe outcome of parsing this example is JSON-LD document encoding a graph with the information about the people described in the \"Person Card\" documents:\n{\n  \"@id\": \"#/\",\n  \"@type\": [\n    \"schema-org:Person\",\n    \"file://vcard.yaml#/declarations/PersonNode\",\n    \"meta:DialectDomainElement\",\n    \"doc:DomainElement\"\n  ],\n  \"schema-org:birthDate\": {\n    \"@type\": \"xsd:date\",\n    \"@value\": \"1926-10-18\"\n  },\n  \"schema-org:name\": \"Chuck Berry\"\n}\n\nThis graph of information can be saved in JSON-LD compatible graph databases or it can be queried using a standard graph query language.\nIn this example the semantics of the information comes from the Schema.org project. Schema.org provides detailed definitions like Person that can be processed by machines and re-used across multiple metadata documents even if the syntactical details to describe a person varies.\nAML dialects describing metadata documents can work with any of these existing vocabularies as long as the concepts in the vocabulary they can be identified by a URI.\nAML also introduces the AML Vocabulary specification to describe new semantics that can be re-used across AML dialects.\nFor example, we could introduce our own \"Personal Information\" AML Vocabulary with our own definitions for classes of entities and properties:\npersonal_info.yaml\n#%Vocabulary 1.0\n\nvocabulary: Personal Information Management\nbase: http://myorg.com/vocabs/personal_info\n\nclassTerm:\n\n  Person:\n    description: Person being described\n\npropertyTerms:\n\n  birth_date:\n    description: date of birth of a person\n\n  full_name:\n    description: full name including surnames\n\nAML Vocabularies can be used in AML Dialect definitions mixing them with external vocabularies.\n"},"overview_amf.html":{"url":"overview_amf.html","title":"What is AMF?","keywords":"","body":"What is AMF?\nAMF (AML Modeling Framework) is an open source library capable of parsing and validating  AML metadata documents.\nAMF is written in Scala(JS) and can be executed in the JVM, Node.js or the browser.\nAMF can be used as a stand-alone command-line tool or as a library in a Scala, Java, web or node applications.\nAMF source code is publicly available under the Apache 2.0 License in the AMF Github repository.\nArtifacts to use AMF can be obtained from:\n\nMaven\nNPM\n\nAMF has a modular architecture where plugins for other types of metadata beyond AML can be integrated. An example of these plugins is the web-api module capable of parsing RAML and OAS (formerly Swagger) API specification languages.\n"},"quickstart.html":{"url":"quickstart.html","title":"Quickstart","keywords":"","body":"Quickstart\nThese pages show you how to get up and running as quickly designing metadata documents with AML, including installing all the tools you'll need.\nAfter completing this first tutorial, follow the different guides in this section to learn additional features available in AML.\nBefore you begin\nPrerequisites:\n\nJVM: version 7 or higher\nSBT to build the AMF command-line\n\nDownload the example\nYou can download the example from the AML project examples repository in Github.\ngit clone https://github.com/aml-org/examples.git\ncd examples/quickstart\n\nBuild and install the AMF command-line tool\nDownload AMF from its github repository and build AMF command-line (you will need Scala SBT):\ngit clone https://github.com/aml-org/amf.git\ncd amf\nsbt buildCommandLine\n\nThis will leave a versioned fat jar (amf-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.jar) in the top level repository of the project.\nCopy this jar file to the top level of the examples repository:\ncp ./amf-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.jar ../examples/amf.jar\n\nDefining an AML Dialect for a new type of metadata documents\nIn this example we will define a new type of metadata documents to exchange information about geographical locations.\nIn order to do this we will define a new type of AML Dialect describing the structure of the document, located in the examples repository in the file aml/quickstart/places.yaml:\nplaces.yaml\n#%Dialect 1.0\n\ndialect: Places\nversion: 1.0\n\nexternal:\n  schema: http://schema.org/\n\nnodeMappings:\n\n  LocationNode:\n    classTerm: schema.Place\n    mapping:\n      name:\n        propertyTerm: schema.name\n        mandatory: true\n        range: string\n      image:\n        propertyTerm: schema.image\n        range: uri\n\ndocuments:\n  root:\n    encodes: LocationNode\n\nThe dialect is very simple. It just defines a document with a couple of nodes one for the place and another one for the geographical location of the place. We are using the Schema.org vocabulary to provide the semantics of the metadata.\nYou can validate the validity of this AML Dialect using AMF. From the top level directory of the examples repository:\nexamples [master] $ java -jar amf.jar validate -in \"AML 1.0\" -mime-in application/yaml file://aml/quickstart/dialects/places.yaml\n{\n  \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#ValidationReport\",\n  \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#conforms\": true\n}\n\nParsing metadata documents\nNow that we have a valid AML Dialect, we can start using it to parse metadata documents with information about different places.\nFor example we can try the golden_gate.yaml document:\ngolden_gate.yaml\n#%Places 1.0\n\nname: Golden Gate\nimage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate#/media/File:Golden_Gate_1.jpg\n\nWe can use AMF to parse and validate the example, passing as an argument the location of the dialect and dialect instance to be parsed:\nexamples [master] $ java -jar amf.jar parse -ds file://aml/quickstart/dialects/places.yaml -in \"AML 1.0\" -mime-in application/yaml -ctx true file://aml/quickstart/golden_gate.yaml\n\nThe following JSON-LD document will be returned in the console:\n[\n  {\n    \"@id\": \"#\",\n    \"@type\": [\n      \"meta:DialectInstance\",\n      \"doc:Document\",\n      \"doc:Fragment\",\n      \"doc:Module\",\n      \"doc:Unit\"\n    ],\n    \"meta:definedBy\": [\n      {\n        \"@id\": \"file://aml/quickstart/dialects/places.yaml#\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"doc:encodes\": [\n      {\n        \"@id\": \"#/\",\n        \"@type\": [\n          \"schema-org:Place\",\n          \"file://aml/quickstart/dialects/places.yaml#/declarations/LocationNode\",\n          \"meta:DialectDomainElement\",\n          \"doc:DomainElement\"\n        ],\n        \"schema-org:image\": [\n          {\n            \"@id\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate#/media/File:Golden_Gate_1.jpg\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"schema-org:name\": [\n          {\n            \"@value\": \"Golden Gate\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"@context\": {\n      \"@base\": \"file://aml/quickstart/golden_gate.yaml\",\n      \"doc\": \"http://a.ml/vocabularies/document#\",\n      \"meta\": \"http://a.ml/vocabularies/meta#\",\n      \"schema-org\": \"http://schema.org/\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nJSON-LD is a W3C standard to store graphs of information with support for hyperlinks. JSON-LD is the native format for AMF parsed graph models.\nUsing vocabularies for custom semantics\nAML allows users to define the semantics for metadata documents in AML Vocabulary files.\nThe file aml/quickstart/geolocation.yaml contains a vocabulary defining a few terms for a custom geolocation vocabulary:\ngeolocation.yaml\n#%Vocabulary 1.0\n\nvocabulary: Geolocation\n\nbase: http://myorg.com/vocabs/geo#\n\nclassTerms:\n\n  Point:\n    description: Single coordinate pair\n\n  Line:\n    description: Pair of points\n\n  Polygon:\n    description: contains at least 4 coordinate points\n\npropertyTerms:\n\n  position:\n    description: Geolocation of an element\n    range: Point\n\n  latitude:\n    description: Geographical latitude\n\n  longitude:\n    description: Geographical longitude\n\nWe could modify our dialect to generate a new version that use the AML Vocabulary for geolocation we have just reviewed:\nplaces_2.yaml\n#%Dialect 1.0\n\ndialect: Places\nversion: 1.1\n\nuses:\n  geo: ../vocabularies/geolocation.yaml\n\nexternal:\n  schema: http://schema.org/\n\nnodeMappings:\n\n  LocationNode:\n    classTerm: schema.Place\n    mapping:\n      name:\n        propertyTerm: schema.name\n        mandatory: true\n        range: string\n      image:\n        propertyTerm: schema.image\n        range: uri\n      location:\n        mandatory: true\n        propertyTerm: geo.position\n        range: CoordinatesNode\n\n  CoordinatesNode:\n    classTerm: geo.Point\n    mapping:\n      lat:\n        propertyTerm: geo.latitude\n        mandatory: true\n        range: double\n      long:\n        propertyTerm: geo.longitude\n        mandatory: true\n        range: double\n\ndocuments:\n  root:\n    encodes: LocationNode\n\nNow we can parse documents that include geographical coordinates like:\ngolden_gate_2.yaml\n#%Places 1.1\n\nname: Golden Gate\nimage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate#/media/File:Golden_Gate_1.jpg\nlocation:\n  lat: 37.81\n  long: 122.5\n\nAnd the geographical information will appear in the graph using the semantic terms defined in our geolocation vocabulary:\nexamples [master] $ java -jar amf.jar parse -ds file://aml/quickstart/dialects/places_2.yaml -in \"AML 1.0\" -mime-in application/yaml -ctx true file://aml/quickstart/golden_gate_2.yaml\n[\n  {\n    \"@id\": \"#\",\n    \"@type\": [\n      \"meta:DialectInstance\",\n      \"doc:Document\",\n      \"doc:Fragment\",\n      \"doc:Module\",\n      \"doc:Unit\"\n    ],\n    \"meta:definedBy\": [\n      {\n        \"@id\": \"file://aml/quickstart/dialects/places_2.yaml#\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"doc:encodes\": [\n      {\n        \"@id\": \"#/\",\n        \"@type\": [\n          \"schema-org:Place\",\n          \"file://aml/quickstart/dialects/places_2.yaml#/declarations/LocationNode\",\n          \"meta:DialectDomainElement\",\n          \"doc:DomainElement\"\n        ],\n        \"schema-org:image\": [\n          {\n            \"@id\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate#/media/File:Golden_Gate_1.jpg\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"schema-org:name\": [\n          {\n            \"@value\": \"Golden Gate\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"http://myorg.com/vocabs/geo#position\": [\n          {\n            \"@id\": \"#/location\",\n            \"@type\": [\n              \"http://myorg.com/vocabs/geo#Point\",\n              \"file://aml/quickstart/dialects/places_2.yaml#/declarations/CoordinatesNode\",\n              \"meta:DialectDomainElement\",\n              \"doc:DomainElement\"\n            ],\n            \"http://myorg.com/vocabs/geo#longitude\": [\n              {\n                \"@value\": 122.5\n              }\n            ],\n            \"http://myorg.com/vocabs/geo#latitude\": [\n              {\n                \"@value\": 37.81\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"@context\": {\n      \"@base\": \"file://aml/quickstart/golden_gate_2.yaml\",\n      \"doc\": \"http://a.ml/vocabularies/document#\",\n      \"meta\": \"http://a.ml/vocabularies/meta#\",\n      \"schema-org\": \"http://schema.org/\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nValidating metadata documents\nIf we try to parse an invalid document the parser will fail and will return an error message and list of errors with syntactic information about the location of the error.\nAs an example you can try to parse the aml/quickstart/piccadilly_circus_error.yaml document in the examples.
